    "Answer-\n",
    "    Dispersion refers to the way data points are spread out or scattered around a central value (like the mean or median) in a data set. \n",

    "        Example: Consider the data set: 3, 5, 7\n",
    "        • The mean is     3 + 5 + 7 / 3 = 15/3 = 5\n",

    "    A random variable is a numerical outcome of a random event or experiment. It assigns a value to each possible outcome of the experiment, \n",
    "    making it easier to work with probabilities and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if you flip a coin, the outcome (heads or tails) can be represented as a random variable.\n",

    "    Types of Random Variables:\n",
    "    1. Discrete Random Variable: \n",
    "       • Takes specific, countable values.\n",
    "       • It represents scenarios where the possible outcomes are distinct and separate.\n",
    "       • Example: The number of heads in 3 coin flips (values could be 0, 1, 2, or 3).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Continuous Random Variable:\n",
    "       • Can take any value within a given range, including fractions and decimals.\n",
    "       • It represents scenarios where the outcomes are not countable but measured.\n",
    "       • Example: The time it takes for a bus to arrive (could be 5.2 minutes, 7.5 minutes, etc.).\n",
    "    \n",

    "    Discrete: Specific, countable values (like whole numbers).\n",
